            <h2> <article>About me</article> </h2>
            <p>My full name is <strong>Alpkan Sarıkaya</strong>. I'm 24 years old, born in Ankara, Turkey. I'm following the program online from my hometown. I chose this program because I want to learn design, and so far, it is going very well.</p>
            <p>My hobbies are reading books, watching movies, general stuff, and I try to learn other design fields like 3d in my spare time. I would like to work in the field of design after the program, especially work in the game industry.</p>
